# Introduction

You can and should cross-reference sections and sub-sections. 

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. @sec-data....



# Data {#sec-data}

Some of our data is of penguins (@fig-bills), from @palmerpenguins.

```{r}
#| label: fig-bills
#| fig-cap: Bills of penguins
#| echo: false

ggplot(penguins, aes(x = island, fill = species)) +
  geom_bar(alpha = 0.8) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4"),
                    guide = "none") +
  theme_minimal() +
  facet_wrap(~species, ncol = 1) +
  coord_flip()
```

Talk more about it.

And also planes (@fig-planes). (You can change the height and width, but don't worry about doing that until you have finished every other aspect of the paper - Quarto will try to make it look nice and the defaults usually work well once you have enough text.)


Talk way more about it. 

# Discussion

## Second discussion point

## Third discussion point

## Weaknesses and next steps

Weaknesses and next steps should also be included.
