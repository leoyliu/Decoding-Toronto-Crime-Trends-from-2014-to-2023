please write me 3 tests skeletons to test this dataset in r code

ChatGPT
Certainly! To perform tests on your dataset, I'll provide three simple checks that you can run in R. These tests will be based on general assumptions about datasets similar to the one you've uploaded, such as checking for data integrity, structure, and content. Since I don't have specific details about your dataset, these tests will be quite generic:

Test for Correct Number of Columns: Assuming you expect a certain number of columns (e.g., one for 'Crime_Type' and one for each year).

Test for No Missing Values: This test will check if there are any missing (NA) values in the dataset.

Test for Positive Values in Year Columns: This test assumes that the counts for each year should be non-negative numbers.

Here's how you could implement these tests in R:

R
Copy code
# Load the dataset
data <- read.csv('/path/to/summary_table.csv')

# Test 1: Check the number of columns
# Replace 11 with the expected number of columns
expected_num_cols <- 11
test1_result <- ncol(data) == expected_num_cols
print(paste("Test 1 Passed:", test1_result))

# Test 2: Check for missing values
test2_result <- !any(is.na(data))
print(paste("Test 2 Passed:", test2_result))

# Test 3: Check for positive values in year columns
# Assuming year columns are from 2014 to 2023, adjust as necessary
year_columns <- c('2014', '2015', '2016', '2017', '2018', '2019', '2020', '2021', '2022', '2023')
test3_result <- all(sapply(data[year_columns], function(x) all(x >= 0)))
print(paste("Test 3 Passed:", test3_result))
Make sure to replace '/path/to/summary_table.csv' with the actual file path of your dataset. Also, adjust expected_num_cols and year_columns based on the actual structure of your dataset. Each test will print whether it has passed or failed.

write me another test skeleton

Certainly! Here's another test you can run on your dataset. This test will check if the sum of crime counts for each year is within a reasonable range. This is a useful test for detecting anomalies or outliers in your data.

Before running the test, you need to define what a "reasonable range" would be for your dataset. This range can be based on domain knowledge or historical data trends. For the sake of demonstration, I'll assume a hypothetical range, but you should adjust it according to your dataset's specifics.

Test: Check if the total crime count for each year is within a specified range

R
Copy code
# Load the dataset
summary_table <- read.csv('/path/to/summary_table.csv')

# Define year columns (assuming they are named as integers)
year_columns <- c(`2014`, `2015`, `2016`, `2017`, `2018`, `2019`, `2020`, `2021`, `2022`, `2023

please write me 5 tests skeletons to test this dataset in r code

ChatGPT
To perform five tests on your dataset "cleaned_toronto_crime_rates.csv", we'll focus on various aspects such as data structure, integrity, and specific content checks. Here are five tests you can run:

Test for Correct Number of Columns: This test will check if the dataset has the expected number of columns.
Test for No Missing Values: This test will verify that there are no missing (NA) values in the dataset.
Test for Positive Values in Count Columns: Assuming the dataset contains count columns, this test checks that these values are non-negative.
Test for Correct Data Types: This test will verify that columns are of the expected data type.
Test for Consistent Year Range: If the dataset contains year data, this test checks if the year range is consistent and as expected.
Here's the R code for these tests:

R
Copy code
# Load the dataset
data <- read.csv('/path/to/cleaned_toronto_crime_rates.csv')

# Test 1: Correct number of columns
expected_num_cols <- 10 # Replace with the expected number
test1_result <- ncol(data) == expected_num_cols
print(paste("Test 1 (Correct Number of Columns):", test1_result))

# Test 2: No missing values
test2_result <- !any(is.na(data))
print(paste("Test 2 (No Missing Values):", test2_result))

# Test 3: Positive values in count columns
# Replace 'count_column' with the actual count column name
count_column <- 'Count'
test3_result <- all(data[[count_column]] >= 0)
print(paste("Test 3 (Positive Count Values):", test3_result))

# Test 4: Correct data types
# Replace with actual expected types and column names
test4_result <- is.numeric(data$Year) && is.character(data$Crime_Type)
print(paste("Test 4 (Correct Data Types):", test4_result))

# Test 5: Consistent Year Range
# Replace with the expected year range
expected_year_range <- 2014:2023
test5_result <- all(data$Year %in% expected_year_range)
print(paste("Test 5 (Consistent Year Range):", test5_result))
Make sure to replace the placeholder values (like 10 for the expected number of columns, 'Count' for the count column, and the year range 2014:2023) with the actual expected values for your dataset. The output of each test will indicate whether it passed (TRUE) or failed (FALSE).

Check unique values in a categorical column (e.g., Crime_Type)
Check column types

ChatGPT
To check unique values in a categorical column and to verify the types of columns in your dataset, you can use the following tests:

Test for Unique Values in a Categorical Column (e.g., Crime_Type): This test ensures that all values in a categorical column are among the expected set of unique values.

Test for Correct Column Types: This test verifies that each column in the dataset is of the expected data type.

Here's the R code for these tests:

R
Copy code
# Load the dataset
data <- read.csv('/path/to/cleaned_toronto_crime_rates.csv')

# Test 1: Check unique values in a categorical column
# Replace "Crime_Type" with the actual column name and define the expected unique values
expected_unique_values <- c("Type1", "Type2", "Type3") # Replace with actual expected types
test_unique_values <- all(unique(data$Crime_Type) %in% expected_unique_values)
print(paste("Test for Unique Values in Crime_Type:", test_unique_values))

# Test 2: Check column types
# Replace the column names and types with the ones you expect in your dataset
test_column_types <- is.numeric(data$Year) && is.factor(data$Crime_Type) # Example
print(paste("Test for Correct Column Types:", test_column_types))
For Test 1, replace Crime_Type with the actual name of your categorical column and expected_unique_values with the list of values you expect to find in that column.

For Test 2, adjust the test conditions based on the actual columns and their expected types in your dataset. For instance, if you expect Year to be numeric and Crime_Type to be a factor, the test is set accordingly. Replace these with the actual column names and types from your dataset.

These tests will print out whether each test has passed (TRUE) or failed (FALSE).
